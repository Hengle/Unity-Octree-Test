# Unity-Octree-Test

In this unity project, you move the camera with the WASD keys, and control where to look by pressing the left mouse button and then moving the cursor.

By pressing the tab button, a cube will spawn ahead of you. You can generate as many cubes as you wish. By pressiong and holding down Q, the cube will move with you (you can use the WASD to translate it or the click plus moving cursor to rotate it around yourself).

The cubes will be the octree's elements, and as you create more, the tree will begin to take shape.

The octree right now handles objects moving. Still not handling object elimination or objects falling outside of the root node.
